# SQL Challenge - Employee Database



## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this challenge, the following will be performed:

1. Data Modeling - design the tables to hold data in the CSVs

2. Data Engineering - import the CSVs into a SQL database

3. Data Analysis - answer questions about the data


#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an [ERD](SQLfiles/ERD.png) of the tables.
